/*  Program Description
Design and implement a Name_pairs class holding (name,age) pairs where name is a string
and age is a double. Represent that as a vector<string> (called name) and a vector<double> 
(called age) member. Provide an input operation read_names() that reads a series of names. 
Provide a read_ages() operation that prompts the user for an age for each name. 
Provide a print() operation that prints out the (name[i],age[i]) pairs (one per line) 
in the order determined by the name vector. Provide a sort() operation that sorts the 
name vector in alphabetical order and reorganizes the age vector to match. Implement all
“operations” as member functions. Test the class (of course: test early and often).
